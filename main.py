There are several ways to optimize this Python script. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use a session object instead of making multiple requests using `requests.get()`. This allows for reusing the same TCP connection and can improve performance.

```python
# Before the RecipeScraper class
session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update({"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})

# Inside RecipeScraper class


def get_recipe_urls(self, num_recipes):
    # Replace "requests.get" with "session.get"
    response = session.get(url)
    ...


def scrape_recipe_data(self, url):
    # Replace "requests.get" with "session.get"
    response = session.get(url)
    ...


```

2. Use list comprehensions instead of `for ` loops when constructing the `analyzed_data` list in the `analyze_preferences` method of the `UserPreferenceAnalyzer` class .

```python
# Replace the for loops with list comprehensions
analyzed_data = [
    {
        "title": recipe["title"],
        "ingredients": recipe["ingredients"],
        "instructions": recipe["instructions"],
        "rating": recipe["rating"],
        "match_score": sum(1 for cuisine in self.preference_data["cuisine_preferences"] if cuisine in recipe["title"].lower()) +
        sum(1 for restriction in self.preference_data["dietary_restrictions"] for ingredient in recipe["ingredients"] if restriction in ingredient.lower()) +
        sum(1 for preference in self.preference_data["ingredient_preferences"]
            for ingredient in recipe["ingredients"] if preference in ingredient.lower())
    }
    for recipe in recipe_data
]
```

3. Move the initialization of `tfidf_vectorizer` and `tfidf_matrix` outside the `get_similar_recipes` method of the `RecipeRecommendationEngine` class . This way, these objects are only created once instead of every time the method is called.

```python
# Before the RecipeRecommendationEngine class
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
recipe_titles = [recipe["title"] for recipe in recipe_data]
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(recipe_titles)

# Inside RecipeRecommendationEngine class


def get_similar_recipes(self, recipe_title):
    title_index = recipe_titles.index(recipe_title)
    ...


```

4. Use a dictionary comprehension instead of a regular `for ` loop when constructing the `recipe_data` list inside the `scrape_recipes` method of the `RecipeRecommender` class .

```python
# Replace the for loop with a dictionary comprehension
recipe_data = [
    scraper.scrape_recipe_data(url)
    for url in recipe_urls
]
```

These are just a few optimizations that can be made. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your program, you may need to consider other ways to optimize the code.
